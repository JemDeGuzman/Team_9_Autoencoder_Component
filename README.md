# Team_9_Autoencoder_Component

Created by: De Guzman, Jemuel Endrew C.
Project Title: Anomalous Packet Detection for Public WiFi Services

The model is intended to be used for detecting anomalies in Network Traffic Data, specifically DDos attacks.

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that was used to train and test 3 Autoencoder structures for the project. These architectures are:
- Simple Autoencoder
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Deep Recurrent Autoencoder (DRAE)

Based on the training and evaluation, the **Simple Autoencoder** performed the best among the 3, with a 0.97 accuracy at a 0.0201 threshold.
